# Center For Healthy Work Resources
During my internship with the Center For Healthy work at UIC, I developed an android application. It is a user-friendly and performance-optimized version of resources to support workers in Chicago and to provide resources to academics, employers, policymakers, and workers to help establish and maintain the belief that all workers deserve healthy work.

This application utilizes Google Sheets as a real-time database to store information for the application. The application fetches the JSON objects using the Google Sheets API from the specified Google Sheet. Afterward, the parsed data is parsed using a class that works as a template to help show that information to the user using recycler view with hyperlinks to websites, phone numbers, and locations.
