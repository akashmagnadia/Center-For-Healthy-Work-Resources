# Center For Healthy Work Resources
During my internship with the Center For Healthy work at UIC, I developed an android application.
It is a user-friendly and performance-optimized version of resources to support workers in Chicago and
to provide resources to academics, employers, policymakers, and workers to help establish and maintain the belief that all workers deserve healthy work.
